Hi! I am a PhD student and researcher in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">Social Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. My main areas of interest are morality and behavior change. Some of the questions I seek to answer in my research include: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>How do people think about transformative experiences?</li>
  <li>Can people accurately predict who is open to changing their beliefs?</li>
  <li>What is the best way to change our own language patterns in socially-minded ways?</li> 
</ul>
<br>
  I work primarily with <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Prof. Jesse Graham</a> and <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Prof. Wendy Wood</a>. Thanks for visiting my website! More content coming soon.
