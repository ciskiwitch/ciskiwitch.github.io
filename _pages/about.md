Hi! I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">Social Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. I study how people change, and how they explain those changes. So far, I've explored personal transformations, including addiction recovery; perceptions of other people's belief changes; and the process of changing one's language in socially desirable ways. I work primarily with <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Dr. Jesse Graham</a> and <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Dr. Wendy Wood</a>.
