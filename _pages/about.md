Hi! I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">Social Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. My two main areas of research are moral psychology and behavior change.

### Moral Psychology

I study how people think about moral changes. So far, I've explored how people view their own morally-relevant personal transformations, such as addiction recovery, and how we view others who change their beliefs. In this research, I work primarily with <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Dr. Jesse Graham</a>.

### Behavior Change

I am interested in how people successfully achieve and maintain behavior changes, particularly for behaviors that are seen as morally-relevant. Currently, I am investigating the process of changing one's language in socially desirable ways. In this line of research, I work primarily with <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Dr. Wendy Wood</a>.
