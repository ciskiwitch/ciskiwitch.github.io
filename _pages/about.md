Hi! I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology">Social Psychology</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. I study how people change in morally-laden ways, and how they think about those changes. Some of my current topics of research include addiction recovery, socially-minded language change, and beliefs about belief change itself. I work primarily with <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Dr. Jesse Graham</a> and <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Dr. Wendy Wood</a>. More content coming soon!
