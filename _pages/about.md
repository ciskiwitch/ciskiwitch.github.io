I am a PhD student and researcher in Psychology at the University of Southern California. I work primarily with <a href="http://eccles.utah.edu/team/jesse-graham/">Prof. Jesse Graham</a> studying moral judgments about ourselves and others, and <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Prof. Wendy Wood</a> studying the power of habit-building for behavior change.

In my research, I combine text analysis, surveys, and experimental techniques to answer questions such as: 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>How do people think about the changes they undergo during a transformative experience?</li>
  <li>Can people accurately predict who is open to changing their beliefs?</li>
  <li>What is the best way to change our own language patterns in socially-minded ways?</li> 
</ul>

 Thanks for visiting my website! More content coming soon.
